# Real-Time Scheduling with POSIX APIs

Welcome to the Real-Time Scheduling with POSIX APIs repository! This repository contains code examples that illustrate how to work with real-time scheduling using POSIX APIs. The focus is on switching to the SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy for deterministic task execution.

## Examples

Explore the `Repository` to find code snippets showcasing:

- Determining the current scheduling policy.
- Setting tasks to use the SCHED_FIFO policy.
- Managing task priorities and deadlines.

Each example comes with a README explaining its purpose and usage.
